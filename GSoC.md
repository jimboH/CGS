# Google Summer of Code 2018 Report

### Achievements  
This year, I worked on the project Contextual Geometric Structure (CGS), which provides a platform for simulating how words and their meanings evolve with respect to time. The code in this repository is basically built from scratch. The achievements I have made in this project include:  
1. Hydrodynamic simulation with the help of the package Parcels.
2. Finite state machine mechanism in determining how words of interest transform between active states and inactive states.
3. Genetic algorithm in determining how meanings of words alter and tend to the meanings with greatest fitness.
4. APIs to show the simulation results in table, plot, and animation.
5. APIs to fetch word frequency data from google ngrams.
6. Provide ipywidgets tools which allow easy usage of CGS on jupyter notebook.
7. List of APIs in API.md.
8. Tutorials of CGS in CGS_tutorials.ipynb.
9. Packaging the project to allow pip installation.

### Things to be done in the future  
1. Testing: test the functions of the project.
